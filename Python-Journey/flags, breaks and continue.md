Here's a **comparison table** for `flags`, `break`, and `continue` in Python:

|Feature|`flag` (Boolean Variable)|`break`|`continue`|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A Boolean variable used to control loops|Exits the loop entirely|Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one|
|**Usage**|Used as a condition to decide whether to continue looping|Used to immediately exit a loop|Used to skip specific iterations while staying in the loop|
|**Scope**|Can be used across multiple loops or functions|Affects only the loop it is inside|Affects only the loop it is inside|
|**Loop Exit?**|No, unless explicitly checked in the condition|Yes, exits the loop entirely|No, continues to the next iteration|
|**Example Use Case**|Tracking when a condition is met across iterations|Exiting early when a specific condition is met|Skipping certain values but continuing the loop|
|**Code Example**|`python flag = False for i in range(5): if i == 3: flag = True if flag: print("Condition met")`|`python for i in range(5): if i == 3: break print(i)`|`python for i in range(5): if i == 3: continue print(i)`|

### **Summary:**

- Use **flags** when you need to track a condition and use it later.
- Use **break** when you want to completely stop a loop.
- Use **continue** when you want to skip an iteration but keep looping.
