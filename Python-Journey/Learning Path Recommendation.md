Given your background in C and prior Python exposure, you can likely accelerate your learning while ensuring you grasp Python-specific concepts. Here's a tailored plan:

### 1. **Assess Your Current Knowledge**
   - **Skip/skim chapters** that cover universal programming concepts you already understand (e.g., variables, loops, conditionals). Use the **"Try It Yourself" sections** or exercises to test yourself.
   - For example, if youâ€™re comfortable with loops in C, see if you can write Pythonic loops (e.g., `for item in list:` instead of `for (int i=0; i<n; i++)`). If you can, move on.

### 2. **Focus on Python-Specific Features**
   Prioritize chapters covering concepts that differ from C or are unique to Python:
   - **Lists, tuples, and dictionaries** (Chapter 4): Pythonâ€™s dynamic data structures.
   - **List/dictionary comprehensions** (Chapter 5/6): Concise ways to create collections.
   - **Functions** (Chapter 8): Pythonâ€™s flexible argument handling (`*args`, `**kwargs`).
   - **Classes and OOP** (Chapter 9): Pythonâ€™s approach to classes (inheritance, `self`, dunder methods).
   - **File I/O and exceptions** (Chapter 10): Pythonâ€™s `with` statements and exception hierarchy.
   - **Modules and libraries** (Chapter 11): Using `pip`, virtual environments, and third-party packages.

### 3. **Do Exercises Strategically**
   - Skip exercises on familiar topics but **do 1â€“2 per chapter** to confirm understanding.
   - If exercises feel trivial, try advanced variations (e.g., refactor code to use list comprehensions or optimize for readability).

### 4. **Jump to Projects Early**
   The second half of the book (Chapters 12â€“20) includes practical projects:
   - A 2D game with Pygame (great for applying OOP).
   - Data visualization with Matplotlib/Plotly.
   - A web app with Django.
   These projects will solidify your skills faster than theoretical exercises.

### 5. **Supplement with External Practice**
   - Use platforms like [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (start with "Easy" problems) to practice Pythonic problem-solving.
   - Explore Pythonâ€™s standard library (e.g., `itertools`, `collections`) through tutorials.

### 6. **Avoid Gaps**
   - Gloss over chapters but **read summaries** (if the book has them) to catch key terms.
   - If you struggle with a project, backtrack to the relevant basics.

### Final Recommendation:
Skim Chapters 1â€“11, focusing on Python-specific sections, and transition to the projects (Chapters 12+) as soon as you feel ready. Use exercises as checkpoints, not obligations. Your C experience will help you debug and structure code, but embrace Pythonâ€™s simplicity and readabilityâ€”itâ€™s okay to write fewer lines for the same task!

**Example Python vs. C Thinking:**  
- In C: `for (int i=0; i<10; i++) { printf("%d\n", arr[i]); }`  
- In Python: `for num in arr: print(num)` or `[print(x) for x in arr]`
