#exercise 2-10
#I already added comments to the code in all the exercises, but whatever
#I'll add some more comments to this code
#This code is a simple program that prints a message with a favourite number
#The number is stored in a variable called fav_number

fav_number = 8
#This is the message that will be printed
message = "My favourite number is " + str(fav_number) + "!"
#This prints the message
print(message)
